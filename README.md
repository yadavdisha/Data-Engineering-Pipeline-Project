# Azure Data Engineering Pipeline Automation Project
##Overview:
This project automates the process of data movement, transformation, and reporting using Azure services. It encompasses the extraction of data from an on-premises SQL Server database, loading it into Azure Data Lake Storage, performing preprocessing and transformation using Databricks, storing the processed data in Azure Synapse Analytics, and generating reports using Power BI. The pipeline is designed to run daily and fetch the latest data for analysis and reporting.
